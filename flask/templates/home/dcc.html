modENCODE Data Coordintation Centre (DCC) collects and vets the raw and interpreted data of the project
(see <a href="http://database.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/bar023?
ijkey=pCzIGdgVR6C9tRd&keytype=ref">
<i>The modENCODE Data Coordination Center: lessons in harvesting comprehensive experimental details</i>
</a>) 
    and release it to the community via a series of four tools using the extensive experimental 
metadata. 
Each tool is aimed for different tasks and end-users, as well as the nature and volume of modENCODE datasets.
<ul>
<li>modMIne: The modMine interface provides researchers with the ability to perform sophisticated ad hoc queries 
on the modENCODE data and metadata.
</li>
<li>GBrowse: genome browser based on the Generic Genome Browser that provides 
researchers with a convenient way to browse modENCODE data organized as a series of graphical tracks 
spanning the worm and fly genomes, alongside core datasets from WormBase and FlyBase
</li>
<li>Graphical Submission Filtering Tool: it displays the submissions available for download in an easy-to-navigate matrix
</li>
<li>A specialised Wiki, with information on protocols, reagents and procedures, accessible through modMine.
</li>
